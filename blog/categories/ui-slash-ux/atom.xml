<!-- more -->


<ul>
<li>Having the channels in a scroll area as opposed to a tabbed area allows for there to not be a limit on number of channels in one network. Tabs bunch up when there are too many channels.</li>
<li>The people area should have it’s own space. This allows for better visibility of who is in the room when there are a lot of people connected. It also adds focus to the area instead of it just being a general module. Knowing who is in the room is a pretty important feature and should not be lumped into the same category as a module.</li>
<li>The module area is for tools that are available to the room. I could imagine all kinds of tools that could go on this “toolbelt”.</li>
<li>The chat area has not changed at all except for a slight reduction in it’s width.</li>
</ul>


<h3>An overview of the module / “toolbelt” area.</h3>

<p><img src="/images/ui_ux_2.jpg"></p>

<p>Having module icons in a tool area is compact and allows for more freedom when making potential future modules.</p>

<h3>The People area</h3>

<p><img src="/images/ui_ux_3.jpg"></p>

<p>The people area is basically the same except that it gets it’s own area. I also think there should be a small area under the name dedicated to any data that needs to be displayed such as status.</p>

<h3>The Channels area</h3>

<p><img src="/images/ui_ux_4.jpg"></p>

<p>The channels area is basically just a list of available channels. I didn’t include a channel delete button anywhere because I think that the admin should be the only one to create and delete channels. I think this is important because a troll could potentially get in and delete all the channels. You could also figure out how to not let trolls in.</p>

<h3>Other Suggestions</h3>

<ul>
<li>I think that the the sound and notifications should be set under the user settings.</li>
<li>The area for the logo should be a little bit bigger. People like to brand the tools they use.</li>
<li>I think that the twitter bootstrap default styles should not be changed. People should be able to make skins/themes.</li>
<li>An upload media button would be cool sitting right next to the submit button in the chat box.</li>
</ul>
